# Movie-Recommender

Movie Recommender is a Machine Learning / Data Manipulation based project, made using Python. It uses libraries like Pandas, Numpy, NLTK, SciKit Learn, etc. It has two types of Recommenders : A "Simple Movie Recommender", which suggests top movies based on the genre inputted by the user, and also parameters like year of its release, popularity and IMDB's Weighted Rating. The second one is "Content Based Recommender", which suggests movies similar to the movie inputted by the user, and other few parameters such as Cast, Crew, Keywords, Director, etc as well.
